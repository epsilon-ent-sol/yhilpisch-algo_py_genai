Using my credential file oanda.cfg create a brief Python script that connects to the Oanda API via the wrapper tpqoa.py and retrieves a few instruments available. Never show/display my credentials as stored in oanda.cfg.

Now create a brief script that retrieves from the Oanda API time series data for Nasdaq 100, for 3 months back from today and with 1 hour granularity (mid price). Never show my creds.

File "/Users/yves/Python/envs/algo/lib/python3.12/site-packages/v20/response.py", line 35, in get
    raise ResponseNoField(self, field)
v20.errors.ResponseNoField: 400 response for GET https://api-fxpractice.oanda.com:443/v3/instruments/NAS100_USD/candles?price=M&granularity=H1&from=2025-04-22T14%3A44%3A15.586694%2B00%3A00.000000000Z&to=2025-04-25T14%3A44%3A15.586694%2B00%3A00.000000000Z does not have field 'candles' (contains 'errorMessage')

Now implement a web-based application with streamlit which allows the selection of an Oanda instrument, the start date (default:-3 months), the end date (default: today), the granularity (default: D), and as price mid price. The data shall be visualized with plotly (candlesticks). Avoid the use of pyarrow in any instance.

The parameter selection is not placed in the sidebar. Everything is in the main pane. Correct this.

Make the display of the data table optional (radio button). Add another figure which compares the closing price of the main instrument to a maximum of two other instruments. Put it under the original figure.

Turning on/off the data table does not work. Neither does the generation of the price comparison chart work.

Add the option to display the price comparison in normalized fashion, i.e. to 1. Also via radio button.
