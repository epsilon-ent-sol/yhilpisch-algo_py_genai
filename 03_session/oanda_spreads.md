## Oanda UK Average Bid-Ask Spread (in Percent)

### Overview

Oanda UK offers variable spreads across different instrument categories. The bid-ask spread (difference between the buy and sell price) is a primary component of trading costs for retail clients. The spread is typically quoted in pips for forex, points for indices, and absolute values for commodities. For comparison, all have been converted to percent of instrument price.

### Typical Average Spreads by Category

| Instrument Type | Example Instrument | Average Spread (pips/points) | Approximate Spread (%) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| FX (Majors) | EUR/USD | 0.8 pips[^1] | 0.007% |
| FX (Majors) | GBP/USD | 1.4 pips[^2][^1] | 0.011% |
| FX (Minors) | EUR/GBP | 0.9 pips[^1] | 0.008% |
| FX (Minors) | GBP/AUD | 3.8 pips[^3] | 0.022% |
| Indices | UK 100 | 1.8 points[^4] | ~0.000024% |
| Indices | Germany 40 | 1.2 points[^5] | ~0.000015% |
| Metals/Commodities | Gold (XAU/USD) | 0.3 USD (typical) | ~0.000016% |

> **Note:** The percent values are calculated by dividing the spread (in quote currency or points) by the current price and multiplying by 100.

### Spread Ranges by Asset Class

- **FX Majors:** Average 0.007–0.02% (spreads are narrowest for most liquid pairs like EUR/USD, wider for minors/exotics)[^1].
- **Commodities/Metals:** Spread (in percent) is extremely low, typically around 0.000016% for gold, but this can fluctuate based on market volatility.
- **Indices:** Spreads for major indices like UK 100 and Germany 40 are quoted from 1.0–1.8 points, percent values are even lower due to high index values, usually about 0.00002%[^4][^5].


### Typical Range (Percent) by Category

- **FX:** 0.007%–0.02%
- **Commodities/Metals:** ~0.00001%–0.0001% (varies by instrument)
- **Indices:** ~0.00001%–0.00003%


### Key Considerations

- Spreads at Oanda are variable and may widen during market open/close, high volatility, or significant news events[^6][^7].
- Actual trading costs may be higher during low liquidity periods.
- Commodity and index spreads look very tight in percent terms due to the much higher nominal prices of these instruments.


### Summary Table

| Asset Class | Typical Spread (%) |
| :-- | :-- |
| FX Majors | 0.007–0.02 |
| FX Minors | 0.015–0.03 |
| Indices | ~0.00001–0.00003 |
| Commodities | ~0.00001–0.0001 |
