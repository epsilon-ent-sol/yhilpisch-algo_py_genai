Accounts
========

You need an Oanda demo account (in/for the UK, that's important):

	https://oanda.com/uk-en/

For Oanda, you should install our Python API wrapper package as follows:

	pip install git+https://github.com/yhilpisch/tpqoa.git

You should have a developer/API account with OpenAI (or an alternative provider):

	https://platform.openai.com

From both platforms you need API keys. See their documentation in this regard.

With the OpenAI API key, you can use `codex` on the CLI:

	https://github.com/openai/codex

For cloud deployment, you should have an account e.g. with DigitalOcean (this link gives you a credit of 200 USD):
